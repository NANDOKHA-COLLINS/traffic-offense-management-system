Generally, we know that road traffic violations are occurring while driving on the road. 
If there is a violation caught by the traffic police officers, they will definitely make a fine according to the violation. 
So, we know that this process is based on paper works, a manual paying system, 
and a temporary driver has to hand over the license to a police officer and this process takes more time. 
Therefore, we have proposed our system to make it smart other than using the normal process. 

The system has major four roles; Traffic Police Admin, Traffic Police Officer, Vehicle Driver, and Department of Motor Traffic. 
The police officer & vehicle driver has the mobile app & web application, traffic police admin, and department of motor traffic have the web portal.
